## Arduino LIVE555 Streaming Media 

[LIVE555](http://www.live555.com/) is a set of open source (LGPL) C++ libraries developed by Live Networks, Inc. for multimedia streaming. The libraries support open standards such as RTP/RTCP and RTSP for streaming, and can also manage video RTP payload formats such as MPEG, AAC, AMR, AC-3 and Vorbis.

It is used internally by well-known software such as VLC and mplayer.

In order to make the library available for Arduino I have 

- Created the src directory with symlinks to all source files
- Deactivated exceptions (with the help of #defines)
- Used lwip as network interface
- Replaced printf(stderr, ...) with a separate LOG() method, so that we can handle them properly in Arduino
- Renamed inet.c to inet.cpp so that we can use c++ classes
- Applied plenty of additional corrections, so that the library runs on an Arduino-ESP32 
- Used a [file abstraction layer](https://pschatzmann.github.io/live555/html/class_abstract_file.html#details) to replace the stdio.h operations so that we can use different SD libraries

The biggest challenge was with the last point. Unfortunately Arduino does not provide a proper stdio.h implementation that can be used to access files. On the other hand most projects assume that stdio.h is available and therfore do not use any additional abstraction layer: live555 is here not an exception.

### Use Cases

- Stream Audio or Video to a Microcontroller
- Stream Audio or Video from a Microcontroller and play it e.g. with the help of the VLC Player

### Project Status

The RTSP Player is working fine but I am really struggeling to make the streaming work. The sound is breaking up and I did not find so far what is causing this. The 

### Installation

For Arduino you can download the library as zip and call include Library -> zip library. Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder e.g. with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone pschatzmann/arduino-live555.git
```

I recommend to use the git method, so that you can simply get updates by executing the ```git pull``` command in the arduino-live555 library folder.

For building and running the code on your desktop, please consult the original [build instructions](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-live555/blob/master/BUILD.md)
